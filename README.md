# Bunty-DiscordBot
Bunty is a fun bot I made using discord.py that manages my discord server.

## Usage:
Bunty doesn't have a specific syntax for each command. It is custom designed for my server alone, in order to facilitate and automate various tasks. Trigger words used to task bunty to perform anything:

- `bunty help` triggers the help menu
